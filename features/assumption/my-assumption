Using Gherkin not a bad thing, it is great because:
- define scenarios from user perspective and at the same time it's extremely descriptive such that there's no ambiguity at all 
- clear and consice Given-When-Then Syntax: can understood by everyone in the team no matter how technical or non-technical
- readily understood: these simple given-when-than statements are easily by every person in team and once you finally 
finish your test automation activities, you simply pass on this report to stakeholders and they understand exactly what the product is meant to do 
and it's all driven through test automation process
